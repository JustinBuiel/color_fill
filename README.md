<h1>Welcome to Color Fill</h1>
This is a silly little project I took on after reformatting my laptop so I could make sure my new development environment was setup to use all of the tools I want with a clean slate. 

This minigame is a part of the training at Lowe's and I thought it would be a fun little python project. It's not perfect but it gets the job done for my purposes.

<h2>Setup</h2>
To run this program you should install the following on your computer:

- Visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Python 3.11 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Visual Studio Code (VSC) is mostly for the image viewer/terminal view you can have where the photo of the board will update automatically instead of opening 20+ windows

You will also have to run the following command with python installed correctly
> pip install Pillow
___
Now that you have all of the required programs and files you can now open the folder in VSC, open a new terminal and run the following command from that terminal panel
> python main.py

You can then open the board.png file that was created and start playing by entering the color names exactly
- white
- black
- blue
- red
- orange
- yellow 

Watch as the board fills up with 1 color by infecting adjacent tiles. You will get a score in the number of moves it took (lower is better); try to beat your own score or challenge your friends!
